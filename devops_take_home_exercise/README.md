# Exercise Information

Hello!

Thanks for your interest in joining us at Aki! This exercise is intended to
help you get an idea of what sort of things we work on as a team, and how we
work, too.

This take home exercise has two parts:

1. Open-Ended and General Questions

There are a number of questions in `questions.md` that can help us understand
where you come from, technically and professionally. These questions are also
an opportunity for you to show and communicate your skills, so creativity and
improvisation is strongly encouraged!

We believe that written and verbal communication is just as important for an
engineer as technical prowess, so some of these questions are open-ended and
non-technical, whereas others are more of the quiz-style type.

You can include your answers inline in `questions.md` or include a separate
plain-text or Markdown file within the same directory.

2. Webapp Exercise

Refer to `README.md` within the webapp exercise directory for more details.


# Deliverable

Please include both parts of the take home exercise in the same zip/tar.gz or
otherwise compressed file.

Considering your personal life and busy schedule, you will have 2-3 days to
complete this exercise although there is no penalty for taking longer
should you need to.
