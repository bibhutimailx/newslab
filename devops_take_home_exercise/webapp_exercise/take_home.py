'''
This application won't work! Your challenge is to fix that.

Please connect this application to a persistent database and encapsulate it in
such a way that you can send us a zip of the dir and we can have this up and
running if we have the following dependencies installed:

* Docker
* Python
* Flask
* SqlAlchemy

How you do so is entirely up to you.

Deliverable: a zip or otherwise compressed file. This file MUST include
take_home.py and it MUST include a README.md that will explain how to run this
app so it works.

HINT: The less we need to type to see that it works, the better :)
